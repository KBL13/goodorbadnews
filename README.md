Using XAMPP, just copy and paste all of the provided files into the lampp folder and access the webpage through localhost.
Using phpMyAdmin, create a database schema 'sys' and create two tables.
One table being Users with columns first_name, last_name, email_addr, password, and portfolio.
The other table is Sentiments with columns co_name, vol_val, sent_val, hi_val, lo_val, and dat_val.
